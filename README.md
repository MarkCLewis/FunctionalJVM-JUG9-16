Abstract: The rise of multicore chips has motivated greater interest in functional languages and has caused traditionally non-functional languages to add more functional features. Scala is a prime example of functional on the JVM. Java 8 brings some functional aspects to Java with lambda expressions and the streams library. This talk will look at functional programming concepts in Scala and show what where you have similar options in Java 8.
